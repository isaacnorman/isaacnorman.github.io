<p>After a serious injury to my lower back in 2001, I found a great osteopath who helped me reduce pain and improve mobility. &nbsp;I was so impressed with the speed and effectiveness of my recovery, it inspired me to pursue a career in the “body work” industry. &nbsp;I began training as a massage therapist in Christchurch in 2001, I am now qualified with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Human Biology and a Diploma in Massage. &nbsp;I have taught massage as a senior tutor at Wellpark College in Auckland for two years, and I have more than 10 years clinical experience in New Zealand and overseas. &nbsp;My clinic, NZ Body Mechanic, is located in Westmere, Auckland.</p>
