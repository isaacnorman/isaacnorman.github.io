I have experience with treating various musculoskeletal conditions. &nbsp;I use a soft tissue manipulative technique and an osteopathic approach in the structural component of my work. &nbsp;With manual therapy, one size doesn’t fit all – the experience I have gained through years of study and clinical practise enables me to customise your treatment. &nbsp;NZ Body Mechanic’ clients range from office workers to builders to sports people, with an array of issues, and I’m sure I can help you too.

Once I have assessed you during your initial consultation, I will structure a specific treatment plan to suit your individual needs, including tips for self care. &nbsp;Many people just like you have already discovered the importance of effective body mechanics and muscular maintenance: &nbsp;treatments play an integral role in keeping your body performing at its best. &nbsp;Look after your body, it’s the only one you’ve got.
